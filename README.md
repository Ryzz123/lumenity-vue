Lumenity Framework is a PHP framework that is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. It is designed to be a lightweight
framework that can be used to build web applications quickly and easily. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, so you can
easily add new features and functionality to your web applications.

### Requirements

- PHP ^8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Apache or Nginx

### Installation

To install Lumenity Framework, you need to have PHP ^8.2 or higher installed on your system. You also need to have Composer installed
on your system. You can install Composer by following the instructions on the Composer website.

Once you have Composer installed, you can install Lumenity Framework by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project lumenity/framework
```

This will create a new directory called `Lumenity` in your current working directory and install Lumenity Framework in that directory.

### Configuration

Once you have installed Lumenity Framework, you need to configure it to work with your web server and database. You can do this by
editing the `.env` file in the `app` directory. You can configure the database connection settings, the base URL of your
web application, and other settings in this file.


```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start a web server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` that serves your web application.
